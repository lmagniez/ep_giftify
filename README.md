#Plugin for Esc@pad's etherpad-lite instance.

This is an original plugin inspired by the ep_markdownify plugin for etherpad-lite. We can do for now simple syntax colorization.

We also deleted some features previously available in ep_markdownify, such as the image preview, in order to satisfy our need for the Esc@pad's project from Culture Numérique. (See https://github.com/CultureNumerique)
